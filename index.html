                <p >A NETFLIX FLIM.Lucifer[1] is the name of various mythological and religious figures associated with the planet Venus. Due to the unique movements and discontinuous appearances of Venus in the sky, mythology surrounding these figures often involved a fall from the heavens to earth or the underworld. Interpretations of a similar term in the Hebrew Bible, translated in the King James Version as the proper name "Lucifer", led to a Christian tradition of applying the name Lucifer, and its associated stories of a fall from heaven, to Satan, but modern scholarship generally translates the term in the relevant Bible passage (Isaiah 14:12) as "morning star" or "shining one" rather than as a proper name, "Lucifer".

                <p >A NETFLIX FLIM.The Suicide Squad is a fictional antihero team appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The first version of the Suicide Squad debuted in The Brave and the Bold #25 (September 1959) and the second and modern version, created by John Ostrander, debuted in Legends #3 (January 1987).

The modern incarnation of the Suicide Squad is Task Force X—a team of incarcerated supervillains who undertake high-risk black ops secret missions in exchange for either parole, work release, and/or reduced prison sentences. Regardless of abilities and talent, every member of the squad is expendable, deniable, and it is expected that not many will return. As expendable assets, all members are fitted with an explosive device in their neck to assure obedience. The Suicide Squad's name alludes to the dangerous nature of their missions. The team is based out of Belle Reve Penitentiary under the directorship of Amanda Waller.
